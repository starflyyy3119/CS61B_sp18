All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: No.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Use cast function to solve the circular index problem.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: No.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: % is actually not equal to mod in Java. For positive numbers, they are the same, but not negative numbers

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: No

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 
Can use less memory in addFirst addLast removeFirst & removeLast methods.
public void addFirst(T item) {
	sentinel.next = new Node<T>(item, sentinel.next, sentinel);
	sentinel.next.next.prev = sentinel.next;
	size++;
}
public T removeFirst() {
	if (isEmpty) { return null }
	T itemToRemove = sentinel.next.item;
	sentinel.next.next.prev = sentinel;
	sentinel.next = sentinel.next.next;
	size --;
	return itemToRemove;
}

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Generally, code is explicit.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Use more memory than the above code.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: Do not use extra memory to finish the methods.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: As above.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: As above.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Yes.
